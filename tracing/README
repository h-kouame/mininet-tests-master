Improved tracing
================

From the command line
---------------------

To enable tracing, follow the steps below to add & enable tracing support.

To add Mininet-specific scheduler tracing:

$ cd kmod; make; insmod ./mntracer.ko

- Does not pollute syslog with printk messages.

To add dequeue packet scheduler tracing:

$ cd htb; make; insmod sch_htb.ko

To check if tracing is enabled:

$ cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer

If it's nop, it's fine.  Our custom tracing will print information
  regardless of any other tracing that's active.

To check for any available tracing events:

$ grep mininet /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_events
mininet:mn_htb
mininet:mn_sched_switch

To start tracing:
$ cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
$ echo 1 > events/mininet/enable
$ cat trace_pipe > /tmp/trace-output

This last command will block.

To stop tracing
$ echo 0 > events/mininet/enable


Bash helper functions
---------------------

Here are bash helper functions that you can add to mininet experiment
shell scripts.  Make sure you call the functions!

These are available in trace.sh.  Include by issuing "source /path/to/trace.sh"
